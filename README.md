# Neochat (The Savage Bot)
 I made this fabulous little app.  
It talks back, it plays rock-paper-scissors, it drops savage one-liners.  

## Features
- Premade responses that are way funnier than me
- Rock-Paper-Scissors (spoiler: the bot cheats)
- Savage comebacks on demand
- Jokes so bad they’re actually good
- Slick UI (yes, I actually tried)

## Why I love it
Because sometimes you just want a bot to roast you  
and still say "Thanks mate!" after.

## Demo Moments
- "Tell me a joke" → *gets roasted* (ex: When your parents dropped you off at pre school, they were arrested for littering.)
- "Let's play rock paper scissors" → *loses anyway*
- "I love u" → "How could you not when I'm this awesome?"

## Why is it on GitHub?
Because it deserves to live in the cloud,  
like the digital legend it is.
