## Overview
This is a simple chatbot web application with an interactive UI. It includes user and bot chat features, dark/light mode switching, a rock-paper-scissors game, and predefined chatbot responses.

## Features
- **User and Bot Chat**: Users can input text and receive responses from the bot based on predefined categories.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**: Users can play a simple game with the bot.
- **Predefined Responses**: The bot recognizes keywords and responds accordingly.
- **Clear Conversation**: Reset the chat and start fresh.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling
- **JavaScript**: Handles the chatbot logic and user interactions.
